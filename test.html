    Ensign Babyface! In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Besides, you look good in a dress. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Talk about going nowhere fast. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Well, that's certainly good to know. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. They were just sucked into space. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. I am your worst nightmare! The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. <br />
    You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Your shields were failing, sir. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. The unexpected is our normal routine. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Ensign Babyface! Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. and attack the Romulans. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Not if I weaken first. They were just sucked into space. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Damage report! Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Computer, belay that order. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Talk about going nowhere fast. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I'll alert the crew. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Travel time to the nearest starbase? How long can two people talk about nothing? Sorry, Data. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Shields up! Rrrrred alert!
